# A-Simple-Streaming-Service-User-Interface


This code belongs to one of the homework I did when I was a sophomore student in university. strutils.h and strutils.cpp 
files which are not my works are given by the instructor of the course. I also added the description of the homework and necessary txt files to this repository. Txt files can be modified according to the format that is given in the description of the homework.
